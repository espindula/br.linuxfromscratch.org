      <h3 id="intro">General information about these FAQ's</h3>
      <dl>
	<dt id="why-faq">Why this FAQ?</dt>
	<dd>
     <p>The FAQ tries to answer questions before they're asked. This saves the
     trouble of asking them, and sometimes, the trouble of encountering a
     problem.</p>
     <p>This does reduce traffic and improve the signal to noise ratio but that
     is merely a useful side effect.</p>
     <p>Since the FAQ isn't the natural place to look for information, items
     should be added to it only if they can't be added to the appropriate
     documentation. Sometimes it will be necessary to add a pointer to the
     information in the documentation.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt id="what-is-lfs">What is LFS?</dt>
	<dd>
     <p>LFS stands for Linux From Scratch which is a project that aims to teach
     you about the inner workings of Linux by building a Linux system by
     downloading, building, and installing the packages yourself.</p>
	  <p>Also check out the <a href="/lfs/index.html">introduction to LFS</a>.</p>
        </dd>
	<dt id="what-is-blfs">What is BLFS?</dt>
	<dd>
     <p>LFS is a very basic system, in massive contrast to traditional
     distributions. The reason is this: LFS is not intended to create your
     system as you want it. It's intended to be just enough to allow you to
     build your system as you want it. It's not an end, it's a beginning. When
     you're done with LFS, you've just started building your system.</p>
          <p>This can be a problem if you're new to Unix systems and want a
          typical desktop install with X and a web browser but have no idea
          what packages you need. For this reason, there is Beyond Linux From
          Scratch, or <a href="/blfs/index.html">BLFS</a>.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt id="contribute">Contributing to this FAQ.</dt>
	<dd>
     <p>Suggestions are more than welcome. The FAQ maintainer can be reached
     either via direct email or on the <a
     href="https://lists.linuxfromscratch.org/sympa/info/lfs-support">LFS support mailing
     list</a>.</p>
     <p>Useful suggestions include the addition of questions that are actually
     frequently asked (with well researched answers) and the removal of
     questions that are obsolete.</p>
     <p>If you intend to regularly contribute to this FAQ, you might want to
     subscribe to the FAQ mailing list. All suggestions, additions (and
     sometimes removals) of the FAQ's are discussed there. Patches against the
     FAQ's are also welcome, although regular text-based contributions are
     accepted as well.</p>
     <p>Everything intended to go in the FAQ without substantial editing must
     be well thought out, checked, and researched; and written in a style
     consistent with the existing content.</p>

      <h3 id="support">Support guidelines</h3>
      <dl>
	<dt id="newbie">What if I'm a newbie to Linux or LFS?</dt>
	<dd>
     <p>If you've read the <a
     href="/lfs/view/stable/prologue/prerequisites.html">prerequisites</a> and
     <a href="/lfs/view/stable/prologue/audience.html">audience</a> pages you
     know that the target audience of LFS are intermediate and advanced Linux
     users. Anybody who has a couple of months experience with Linux and
     especially the console should be able to successfully assemble an LFS
     system.</p>
     <p>While LFS seems like a good guide for newbies to Linux, the reality is
     actually quite different. Experience with the support channels shows that
     LFS is hard to grasp and a frustrating experience for newbies because they
     lack understanding of the basic concepts.</p>
     <p>Practically, this means that newbies should get some experience before
     starting with LFS. The <a
     href="/lfs/view/stable/prologue/prerequisites.html">prerequisites page</a>
     lists the minimal required Linux knowledge, but please also read the <a
     href="/hints/downloads/files/">&quot;Essential pre-reading for life with
     LFS&quot;</a> hint.</p>
     <p>These documents and this FAQ are your basic Linux survival guide.
     You'll have a great time with LFS if you've read them, and may have some
     difficulty with LFS and the community, but most likely yourself, if you
     haven't read them.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt id="getting-help">Where is the best place to get help?</dt>
	<dd>
	  <p>When this FAQ fails to help, there are several places to go.</p>
     <p>If you're having a problem with something in the book, it never hurts
     to go back over the book. It's surprising how easy it is to overlook
     little things.</p>
     <p>If nothing else, reading the appropriate man and info pages will yield
     useful information on some subject, if not what you were looking for, and
     ensure that you know enough not to embarrass yourself if you have to ask
     someone.</p>
     <p><a href="https://www.tldp.org/">The Linux Documentation Project</a> has
     the HOW-TOs and a great deal of other documentation. You might find
     something there.</p>
     <p>The <a href="/search.html">website's search</a> includes the mailing
     lists. Many questions have been discussed there at least once. </p>
     <p>For support-type help, IRC is often best. It's faster, and doesn't clog
     the mailing lists. There's more information about the <a
     href="/support.html#irc">IRC channels</a> on the <a
     href="/support.html">support</a> webpage.</p>
	  <p>There are a few IRC channels of interest.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="irc://irc.libera.chat/lfs">#lfs</a> - the LFS community channel.</li>
            <li><a href="irc://irc.libera.chat/lfs-support">#lfs-support</a> - Support for LFS and BLFS.</li>
            <!--<li><a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/hlfs">#hlfs</a> - Support for the HLFS book.</li>-->
          </ul>
          <p>If you are asking a support question, you are more likely to
          attract competent and friendly help in <a
          href="irc://irc.libera.chat/lfs-support">#lfs-support</a>.</p>
     <p>As a last resort, there are the mailing lists. People will get
     frustrated with you if you use the wrong one or cross post. Mailing list
     information is on the <a href="/support.html#mailinglists">support
     webpage</a> and tells which list to use.</p>
     <p>Please remember to provide enough information when you post to the
     mailing lists. In <a
     href="/lfs/view/stable/chapter01/askforhelp.html">chapter 1 of LFS</a> you
     find a good method for posting. Additionally, someone has written <a
     href="/hints/downloads/files/errors.txt">a hint</a> which details the
     error reporting procedure.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt id="which-list">Which list should I use for what topic?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Information about all the public mailing lists is available on the
          <a href="/mail.html">mailing list</a> page.  Here are some general
          guidelines about which list to use:</p>
	  <ul>
       <li>Send <em>support</em> questions for the stable released books to <a
       href="https://lists.linuxfromscratch.org/sympa/info/lfs-support/">lfs-support</a>.
       For anything which doesn't belong in LFS, use <a
       href="https://lists.linuxfromscratch.org/sympa/info/blfs-support/">blfs-support</a>.
       Bug reports are gladly accepted; you can report to the <a
       href="https://lists.linuxfromscratch.org/sympa/info/lfs-dev/">lfs-dev</a>
       mailing list.</li>
       <li>If you are not having trouble following the <em>LFS</em> Book
       itself, do <em>not</em> email <a
       href="https://lists.linuxfromscratch.org/sympa/info/lfs-support/"><em>lfs</em>-support</a>.
       You may ask questions via lfs-support if you are following the LFS
       Book with some customization or deviation, but you should mention
       your deviation in the mail to avoid from puzzling people.</li>
       <li>Unless you are <em>suggesting an improvement</em> to the LFS Book
       itself, do not email <a
       href="https://lists.linuxfromscratch.org/sympa/info/lfs-dev/">lfs-dev</a>.</li>
       <li>Only suggestions concerning the BLFS Book are acceptable on <a
       href="https://lists.linuxfromscratch.org/sympa/info/blfs-dev/">blfs-dev</a>.</li>
       <li>Things are a little different with <a
       href="https://lists.linuxfromscratch.org/sympa/info/blfs-support/">blfs-support</a>.
       Everything that doesn't fit one of the preceding lists fits there except
       for the price of beer and GNU versus BSD flame wars.</li>
       <li>The price of beer, GNU versus BSD, Microsoft versus Linux,
       or Intel versus ARM flame wars, and hardware discussion unrelated to
       building and running LFS are prohibited.</li>
	  </ul>
     <p>Of special note is that if you mention Xorg, Wayland, KDE, GNOME, or
     anything in BLFS, you may be sure that your post does not belong on <a
     href="https://lists.linuxfromscratch.org/sympa/info/lfs-dev/">lfs-dev</a>
     or <a
     href="https://lists.linuxfromscratch.org/sympa/info/lfs-support/">lfs-support</a>.</p>

	<dt id="netiquette">What about netiquette?</dt>
	<dd>
     <p>Here are some practical points of etiquette. They include only those
     items that will draw mention if missed. Those who've been around project
     mailing lists awhile will find the first few obvious. There are less
     obvious items toward the end.</p>
     <p>The reasons for these points are omitted for brevity, but rest assured,
     these guidelines are more than just an individual's personal
     preference.</p>
     <p>While the text refers to "the lists" exclusively, it doesn't intend to
     ignore the news groups that mirror the mailing lists.</p>
     <p>With that out of the way, here are a couple manners oriented items
     followed by more "mechanical" stuff:</p>
     <p>Please remember that it is rude to post questions that are answered in
     commonly available documentation such as the LFS and BLFS Books, this FAQ,
     the LFS Hints, the appropriate man pages, the list archives, and Google
     searches. As long as you can demonstrate that you've made an effort to
     find the answer and you're not offended by a pointer to documentation, no
     reasonable person will object to your question.</p>
     <p>Most of the bothersome flame wars start when a newbie posts an obvious
     question, is then criticized (even in a kindly manner), and becomes
     publicly offended. Please try to avoid this situation. "Wordlessly"
     pointing to the exact spot in the documentation is sufficient. If you feel
     you must criticize, please do it via private email, not on the lists. The
     same applies to anything else that may become heated.</p>
     <p>The lists have an international membership so slang of all sorts and
     idioms are likely to be misunderstood. (Witness the recent discussion of
     "bootstrapping".) Any mention of profanity, politics, war, or religion
     (even in signatures) is likely to upset someone somewhere in the world so
     please avoid them as well. Finally, it is considered polite to post in
     English since many more people on the lists know it than any other
     language.</p>
	  <p>Now for the more "mechanical" stuff.</p>
	  <ul>
       <li><strong>Do not post in HTML.</strong> If you use Yahoo, Hotmail, or
       Outlook and haven't turned HTML off, then it is on. If you're using
       another mail client, please do check before posting. If you don't know
       how to turn HTML off, see <a href="nomime.html">nomime.html</a>.
       <strong>Posts with HTML may reach the list but then rendered in a
       completely unreadable manner by the mail client of the
       subscribers, causing them to give up reading and replying your
       mail.</strong></li>
       <li><strong>Wrap text at 72 characters.</strong> If you do not wish to
       do this by hand, set your mail client to do it automatically when
       sending.</li>
       <li><strong>Reply <em>below</em> quoted text.</strong></li>
       <li><strong>Limit signatures to four lines.</strong></li>
       <li><strong>Trim quoted text,</strong> especially signatures. But
       <strong>do not trim so that it is confusing to read your reply</strong>
       without consulting the original.</li>
       <li><strong>Do not click reply unless you're actually replying to a
       post.</strong> Use new, or compose, or whatever your mail client calls
       it, to ask a new question or start a new thread. Reply sets more than
       just the subject line and will cause your post to appear in the wrong
       place unless you're actually answering.</li>
	  </ul>
     <p>The following isn't major, but is useful to know. On the LFS lists,
     people usually clear the CC field and just mail the list with replies.
     This is probably not a good idea but is existing practice due to a
     political situation which is unlikely to change.</p>

	<dt id="why-not-version">Can I use a version newer than the one in the Book?</dt>
	<dd>
     <p>If this is your first time building LFS, using a version not in the
     book or varying from the book in any way is not a good idea. The IRC
     channel regulars have a saying, &quot;FBBG&quot;, meaning &quot;Follow
     Book, Book Good.&quot; They and the people on the lists have helped many
     an unhappy newbie who deviated from the book during that first build.</p>
     <p>Once you've built a system &quot;by the book&quot;, you have a stable
     knowledge base from which to experiment to your heart's content (or pain,
     as is often the case.)</p>
	</dd>
	<dt id="new-version">There's a new version of package Foo.</dt>
	<dd>
     <p>If the new version is more than a day old, it is likely that someone
     has tested the release and reported it on the mailing lists. Please search
     the archives before posting questions about whether it works.</p>
     <p>And, please note that different packages have different versioning
     schemes.  For example, for many packages versions with an odd minor
     version (&quot;y&quot; in &quot;x.y.z&quot;) are development snapshots
     and some other packages use patch levels (&quot;z&quot; in
     &quot;x.y.z&quot;) greater than or equal to 90 for pre-releases.
     LFS/BLFS won't use development snapshots or pre-releases unless there
     is a good reason.</p>
	  <p>If you'd like to report the new release, follow these steps to avoid making a duplicate report.</p>
	  <ul>
       <li>Check for open <a
       href="https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/">LFS tickets</a> or <a
       href="https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/">BLFS tickets</a> to see if
       the release has been posted there.</li>
       <li>If the release is not in an open ticket, report it to lfs-dev (or
       blfs-dev for packages in BLFS). And if you like, test it and report any
       problems or changes in compilation instructions, too.</li>

	<dt id="shutdown-on-fsck-error">The system shuts down when fsck errors out!</dt>
	<dd>
     <p>Unix systems normally run sulogin if the normal bootup fsck run errors
     out so that root can log in and fix it. Because sulogin will accept any
     password if /etc/passwd is corrupt, the LFS developers decided this was a
     security risk. Therefore, the LFS bootscripts shut the machine down if
     fsck errors, and it must be booted with the "init=/bin/bash" kernel
     parameter to get a root shell. Whether this is wise is beyond the scope of
     the FAQ, but if it doesn't work for you you'll want to change that boot
     script before it's too late.</p>

	<dt id="how-to-upgrade">How do I upgrade my LFS/BLFS system?</dt>
	<dd>
     <p>You probably know this already, but LFS is not a distro in the
     traditional sense. Its primary goal is: <a href="/lfs/index.html">teaching
     people how a Linux system works internally</a>.</p>
     <p>While this means you have great control over your system (&quot;Your
     distro. Your rules.&quot;), it also has the drawback of having to take
     care of updating it yourself.</p>
     <p>Please read
     <a href="../lfs/view/development/chapter08/pkgmgt.html">the section
     named "Upgrade Issues"</a> carefully before upgrading any package.</p>
     <p>If you've built an LFS system and have extended it to become your
     primary system, the best thing to do is to decide on an upgrade policy. Do
     you want to keep the latest version of every package? Then be careful,
     because you're going to be burned. I recommend slight conservatism when
     upgrading to keep a healthy system. A general rule of thumb which works
     for most people is: only upgrade packages if they have security fixes.
     Periodically check
     <a href="../lfs/advisories/">LFS</a> and
     <a href="../blfs/advisories/">BLFS</a> security advisories, and
     subscribe to LWN to keep yourself informed about security
     fixes. Another rule of thumb is: don't upgrade glibc and Linux kernel
     headers unless you're going to rebuild your entire system. These
     packages form the heart of your LFS system, destroying them means
     destroying the ability to compile packages or even run binaries. </p>
     <p>Remember that updating packages is at your own risk. LFS takes great
     care to present a stable mix of packages which are compatible all the way
     up to BLFS so you can compile OpenOffice.Org and Java (which are real
     dinosaurs to compile). This means that your LFS system may get slightly
     outdated but ensures compatibility and stability. You can compare this to
     Debian's stable and testing releases, although LFS stable is generally
     bleeding-edge compared to other distro's. </p>
     <p>In general it is safe to upgrade single packages; they'll just
     overwrite the old contents. Package managers take care of uninstalling old
     versions, and it's really convenient to have some sort of package
     management system in place. Have a look at the hints; there are several,
     ranging from RPM to DEB to TGZ (Slackware) to Checkinstall to package
     users. </p>
     <p>A final comment: what package instructions should you use when updating
     a package? In general, you can use the standard LFS instructions, although
     you shouldn't blindly assume they will apply to all packages. To keep
     yourself informed about upgrades and new package instructions, subscribe
     to lfs-dev. Keep in mind that this is not a support list but a development
     list.</p>

        <dt id="sudo-book-commands">The commands in LFS/BLFS book does not work with sudo!</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>sudo can only run executables as root.  It does not understand
          internal grammar constructs of the shell, for example "case",
          "cd", "for", "if", "|" (piping), "&gt;" (redirecting output to a
          file), etc.</p>
          <p>For example, when the book tells to run <code>echo /bin/zsh
          &gt;&gt; /etc/shells</code> as the root user,
          you cannot run <code>sudo echo /bin/zsh &gt;&gt;
          /etc/shells</code> as a non-root user and expect it to work.
          The output redirection is performed by the shell, so the shell
          needs to open <code>/etc/shells</code> for write and doing so
          requires a privilege.  But sudo has no way to raise the privilege
          for the current shell. It can only raise the privilege for the
          <code>echo</code> command with <code>/bin/zsh</code> as the
          parameter, but this is not helpful at all.</p>
          <p>For another example, when the book tells to run <code>for i in
          /usr/lib/libfoo*.so; do chmod 755 $i; done</code>, you cannot
          prepend <code>sudo</code> before the command and run it as a
          non-root user. <code>for</code> is a shell grammar construct, not
          an executable.  So sudo will report "for: command not found".</p>
          <p>If you do not know how to use sudo correctly, don't use it.</p>
