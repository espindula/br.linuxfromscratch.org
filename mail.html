    <h2>Preamble</h2>
    
    <p>Before you post to the mailing lists, please check if your answer has
    already been answered in the 
    <a href="/faq/">FAQ</a>, on the 
    <a href="/search.html">search page</a> or by other
    methods on the 
    <a href="/support.html">support page</a>. If you don't
    understand an answer in the FAQ or would like some more information, send
    an e-mail to the 
    <a href="mailto:webmaster@linuxfromscratch.org">FAQ maintainer</a>.</p>

    <p>If you're finished with the LFS Book, use blfs-support instead. Please
    read <a href="/faq/#netiquette">the netiquette rules</a> before
    posting!</p>

    <p style="font-weight:bold; font-size:large;">You must subscribe to a list before posting.</p>
    
    <p style="font-weight:bold;">Important mailing list etiquette</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not top post. Reply posts should be at the end of message or
          interspersed in the message if making multiple points.<br/>
          <pre>
             A. Because it messes up the order in which people normally read text.
             Q. Why is top-posting such a bad thing?
             A. Top-posting.
             Q. What is the most annoying thing in e-mail?
          </pre>
      </li>

      <li>When replying, trim non-relevant text, including the mailing list 
          footers if your email client does not do that automatically.
      </li>

      <li>Post using plain text, not html.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2 id="archives">Archives</h2>
    
    <p>Every mailinglist is archived and can be browsed through online. The
    archives are always current. The links to the archives is available through
    each lists' Archive page.</p>
    
    <p>The archives are split by month. If you don't want to just browse but
    are actually looking for specific information, you'll be better off
    searching through the archives using the 
    <a href="/search.html">search engine</a> or list archive search function.
    </p>
    
    <h2 id="subscribe">Subscribe</h2>
    
    <p>The easiest way to subscribe is via the 
    https://lists.linuxfromscratch.org/sympa/info/&lt;list&gt;"page.
    Just select "Subscribe"</p>
    
    <p>The mailing list software allows you to log in, but it is only required
    to customize list options or to unsubscribe. When loging in for the first
    time, select "First login?".   You will receive a message with a link where 
    you will be able to set your password. Note that this only has to be
    done once and your password is good for all LFS mailing lists.</p>
 
    <h2 id="unsubscribe">Unsubscribe</h2>
    
    <p>To unsubscribe from a list, go to the list info page and
    select "Unsubscribe".</p>
    
    <h2 id="filters">Filters</h2>
    
    <p>Every email sent out by the mailinglist software at linuxfromscratch.org
    will have the list name in square brackets at the beginning of the
    Subject: line.
    So this header for an email
    to lfs-dev will look like <code>[lfs-dev] Some title</code> and an email to 
    blfs-support will look like <code>[blfs-support] Another title</code>.</p>
    
    <p>We suggest you use the Subject: header to filter incoming
    LFS mail to your mail folders.</p>
    
    <h2 id="digests">Digests</h2>
    
    <p>All lists have the digest mode available which can be set after a user
    has subscribed to a list. Being in digest mode will cause you to stop
    receiving individual messages as they are posted to the list and instead
    receive a periodic email containing all the messages posted to the list
    since the previous period.</p>
    
    <p>This setting can be configured via the "Subscriber Options" link
    on each list. </p>
    
    <h2 id="vacation">Vacation mode</h2>
    
    <p>If you are going to be away for a while or wish to stop receiving
    messages from the lists but don't want to unsubscribe, you can change to
    vacation mode. This has the same effect as unsubscribing, but without
    having to go through the unsubscribe process and then later through the
    subscribe process again. </p>
    
    <p>This setting can be configured via a form on the "Subscriber Options" link
    on each list.</p>
