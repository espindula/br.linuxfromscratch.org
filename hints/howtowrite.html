    <h2>How to write a hint</h2>

    <p>A good hint provides information which is not otherwise easily
    obtainable. In general, we're not interested in hints which copy
    information already in LFS or BLFS or hints which simply list the steps
    needed for installing a package as explained in the INSTALL or README of a
    package.  </p>
    
    <p>This still leaves a broad scope of subjects. Hints can be about anything
    for which a non-obvious or non-trivial fix or hack is required.  A hint can
    also explain a complicated package installation or a particular setup.
    Have a look at some <a href="read.html">other hints</a> to get an idea of
    what a hint may include.  Also check out the <a
    href="adoptahint.html">Adopt a hint program</a> in case there is some cute
    little hint that you would like to nurture or if someone has suggested a
    topic for a hint that you have knowledge about.  </p>
    
    <p>Once you have a good idea for a hint, you can start writing. Stick to
    the following style rules if you want to submit it for inclusion.  </p>

    <h2>Submission guidelines</h2>
    <ul>
       
       <li> Before submitting a hint, check if there is an already existing
       hint on the topic. If there is then contact the author if you have any
       updates. If the previous author is not interested in maintaining the
       hint, or if there is no response from the author for at least a month,
       then you may take over maintenance of the hint. Remember to CC
       blfs-dev@lists.linuxfromscratch.org  regarding all correspondence with
       the author so that the hint maintainers are aware of the changeover.<br
       /> <i>Note that this does not mean that duplicate hints on the same
       topic are not allowed.  If you feel that the current author has a
       different approach to a problem and you have one which does not match
       the current hint, feel free to submit a separate hint. We suggest
       communicating with the current author(s) before writing the hint. We
       suggest writing a short blurb on how the new hint differs from the
       existing one.</i></li>

       <li>Hints should be reserved for things that cannot be included into the
       book. Hints that relate to installation of packages and which would
       easily fit into the book (usually the BLFS book) should be submitted to
       the relevant development list. If you are conversant with docbook and
       XML, then feel free to submit a patch to the current development version
       of the relevant book..  If not, submit a text file matching the current
       format of the book and a book editor will do the necessary
       modifications.</li>
       
       <li>If you are in the process of writing a hint on a topic, it would be
       good to drop a line to the relevant list in case someone else is working
       on something similar.</li>
       
       <li>A hint should not duplicate documentation that is already available
       elsewhere on a particular topic. It should complement it. Documentation
       available elsewhere includes <a href="http://www.tldp.org/">LDP
       documentation</a>, and documentation available from the package website,
       documentation available by a simple <a
       href="https://www.google.com/">google search</a>. Also, things that are
       already well documented in the book(s) or at the LDP should not be
       repeated in the hint unless the hint describes matters in more detail,
       in a different way, or from a different perspective. So things such as
       installation of db, freetype, zlib, etc can just be referenced by
       pointers to the book.</li>
       
       <li>Authors who are not interested in maintaining their hints any more
       should send a message to the appropriate mailing list specifying that
       the hint is <a href="adoptahint.html">up for adoption</a>. The author
       should also notify the hints list if the hint is not relevant
       anymore.</li>
       
       <li>Hints that have been integrated into the book will be retired after
       a stable version of the book is released.</li>
       
       <li>Keep the file name of the hint short, but descriptive. The extension
       for the hint should be .txt. The name may be composed of a combination
       of lowercase letters, numbers, and a few symbols _ - +.</li>
       
       <li>The hint document is text based. The format for the hints is as
       explained at the end of this document.</li>
       
       <li>Avoid including scripts and patches in the hints. Keep these as
       separate files to avoid spoiling the beauty of the hint.  :)  Patches
       should follow the <a href="/patches/">patches format</a>. The patches
       that you submit will be committed to the patches repository (so be sure
       to mention the hint in the patch description) under the appropriate
       package name. The scripts or patches that don't fit into the patches
       project will be available from the <a
       href="downloads/attachments/">Attachments</a> link on the <a
       href="download.html">download page</a>.  If you need to reference any
       patches in your hint, point to the patches subproject (e.g.
       http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/patches/&lt;package_name&gt;/&lt;patch_name&gt;).
       If you need to reference to any attachments, point to the attachments
       directory (e.g.
       http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/attachments/&lt;hint_name&gt;/)
       Don't worry if the URIs are incorrect, the maintainer will modify the
       URIs before submitting.  Since maintainers are sometimes lazy, you may
       need to give them a bit of a push/shove to "do the right thing".</li>
       
       <li>To submit or update a hint, send an e-mail to the <a
       href="https://lists.linuxfromscratch.org/sympa/info/blfs-dev">blfs-dev
       mailing list</a>. From there it will be picked up by the hint
       maintainer, who will update the hint index and the tarball. You must be
       subscribed to the list to post a message to avoid spam on the list.
       </li>
       
       <li><em>Note that by submitting a hint, you agree to the conditions
       mentioned on this page with respect to the hint. In particular, you
       allow other users to take over the maintainership of the hint if another
       user contacts you with a request (for taking over the maintainership or
       integrating his/her work in your hint) and you fail to respond to the
       request for a month. If you would not like someone to take over the
       maintainership of the hint, please state so clearly in the hint.
       Authors should also keep the contact information updated.</em></li>
       </ul>
       
       <h2>Hint Format</h2>
       
       <p>Every hint should have the following sections, <i>in the order
       specified here</i> so as to have a consistent look and feel.  Sections
       that are supposed to be single lines should be on the same line as the
       section header. Sections that are more than one line should begin from
       the line following the header. Check out the <a
       href="sample-hint.txt">example hint</a> to get an idea about the format.
       </p>
       
         <h3>AUTHOR:</h3>
       
         <p>This field can be repeated if there are multiple authors. Each
         author line should have name and contact details of the hint author.
         Restrict this field for the current authors of the hint. Previous
         authors should be acknowledged in the ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS section.  </p>
         
         <h3>DATE:</h3>
         
         <p>The date the hint was last updated in international format
         (YYYY-MM-DD).</p>
         
         <h3>LICENSE:</h3>
         
         <p>The license under which the hint is licensed. The hint maintainers
         suggest the GNU Free Documentation License, but you are free to choose
         your own. The GNU Free Documentation License allows copying of your
         hint and modifying it without restriction, with the exception that you
         will always be credited as author. It also indicates that the hint
         carries no guarantees. For more information on various licenses, visit
         the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html">GNU
         website</a>.  Before submitting the hint, verify that a copy of the
         LICENSE under which your hint is licensed is available in the <a
         href="downloads/files/LICENSES/">LICENSES directory</a>.  If not, at
         the time of submission of the hint, also include a note and a URI for
         the hint maintainer to download a text copy of the LICENSE.  </p>
         
         <h3>SYNOPSIS:</h3>
         
         <p>A one line description about the hint. Please keep this short and
         sweet and restrict it to a single line since this is the title that
         would be included on the hints page.  </p>
         
         <h3>PRIMARY URI:</h3>
         
         <p>This is an optional section for authors who like to host their own
         hints and only submit occasional updates to the LFS hints site.
         </p>
         
         <h3>DESCRIPTION:</h3>
         
         <p>A short description on why the hint was written, who is the target
         audience, etc. This would help a user in determining whether the hint
         is useful for her/him.  </p>
         
         <h3>ATTACHMENTS:</h3>
         
         <p>Links to additional downloads such as patches, scripts, config
         files, etc. This section is optional.</p>
         
         <h3>PREREQUISITES:</h3>
         
         <p>In this section list the pre-requisites that the user needs to be
         aware of before following the hint.  This section can be used to
         indicate if the hint is applicable only for a particular LFS version.
         </p>
         
         <h3>HINT:</h3>
         
         <p>This is the heart of the hint. List the details about your hint
         here. There is no restriction on how you format things in this
         section, except (there is always some exception) to avoid lines that
         look like a section (i.e. Text in all UPPERCASE followed by a
         semi-colon). Also, make your best effort to restrict each line to 80
         columns (though this can be relaxed on case-by-case basis). Avoid
         including material that is already in the book.  </p>
         
         <h3>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:</h3>
         
         <p>Acknowledgements for people who have contributed to the hint. This
         section is optional.</p> <h3>CHANGELOG:</h3>
         
         <p>Include timestamped changes that have occurred in the hint. Add
         latest entries at the end. Entries in this section should be as
         follows: </p>
         
         <ul>
           <li>[YYYY-MM-DD]</li>
           <li>&nbsp;*&nbsp;Changed A</li>
           <li>&nbsp;*&nbsp;Changed B</li>
         </ul>
       
       <h2>NOTE:</h2>
       
       <p> These instructions are based on responses from many users.  If you
       have suggestions for improving this document, feel free to discuss it on
       the blfs-dev mailing list.  </p>
