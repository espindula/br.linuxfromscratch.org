    <h3>Binutils</h3>

    <h4>10.1 080 Binutils Date: 2021-07-23 Severity: Moderate</h4>
    <p>Binutils before 2.37 is vulnerable to an arbitrary filesystem access,
    denial of service, and two arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities. These
    vulnerabilities have been rated between Low and Moderate by NVD.
    To fix these, update to Binutils-2.37 or later. See
    <a href="../../blfs/advisories/consolidated.html#sa-10.1-080">10.1-080</a></p>

    <!-- End of Binutils -->

    <h3>Expat</h3>

    <h4>10.1 052 Expat  Date: 2021-05-29  Severity: Medium</h4>
    <!-- slackware rated ths as medium, no current state at NVD -->
    <p>Expat before 2.4.0 is vulnerable to Denial of Service ('billion laughs')
    attacks. The vulnerability was initially for versions up to 2.1, but
    protection has been strengthened in the 2.4.0 release: see
    <a href="../../blfs/advisories/consolidated.html#sa-10.1-052">10.1-052</a></p>

    <h3>Glibc</h3>

    <a id="sa-10.1-106"/>
    <h4>10.1 106 (LFS) GLIBC  Date: 2022-03-01  Severity: Critical</h4>
    <p>On reviewing the vulnerabilities fixed in glibc-2.35 it became apparent
    that these, and one earlier vulnerability the editors had not been aware of,
    also applied to glibc-2.33 as used in LFS-10.1. Please see
    <a href="../../blfs/advisories/consolidated.html#sa-10.1-106">10.1-106</a></p>

    <h4>10.1 098 (LFS) GLIBC  Date: 2021-08-24  Severity: High</h4>
    <p>A vulnerability in the released version of glibc-2.34 has been discovered.
    This is remotely exploitable and can be used to crash programs linked to
    glibc. In the development book this unfixed vulnerability existed between
    2021-08-02 and 2021-08-20, it was also in LFS-11.0-rc1. It has been fixed
    with a sed in the chapter 8 glibc build. For further details see
    <a href="../../blfs/advisories/consolidated.html#sa-10.1-098">10.1-098</a></p>

    <h3>Linux Kernel</h3>

    <h4>10.1 078 Linux Kernel (LFS)  Date: 2021-07-20  Severity: High</h4>
    <p>In linux kernels from 3.16 to 5.13.3, a vulnerability in the filesystem
    layer can be exploited to gain root privileges. To fix this, update to
    linux-5.13.4 or later (or 5.10.52 or later for the stable series). See
    <a href="../../blfs/advisories/consolidated.html#sa-10.1-078">10.1-078</a></p>

    <h4>10.1 062 Linux Kernel (LFS)  Date: 2021-06-16  Severity: High</h4>
    <p>In Linux-5.12.10, several security vulnerabilities were fixed in the
    Bluetooth stack, the Xen stack, and the Wireless stack. The Bluetooth
    and Xen stack vulnerabilities allow for local users to cause a kernel panic.
    The Wireless stack vulnerabilities allow for remote attackers to exfiltrate
    data from a system, inject malicious packets and network frames into the
    stream, and decrypt packets that are sent from wireless cards. Additional
    fixes were made for issues in the ath10k and ath11k wireless drivers.
    For more information, see the information in
    <a href="../../blfs/advisories/consolidated.html#sa-10.1-062">10.1-062</a></p>

    <h4>10.1 054 Linux Kernel (LFS)  Date: 2021-03-31  Severity: High</h4>
    <p>In Linux 5.12.7 and all earlier kernels back to 2.6.12 a "confused
    deputy" weakness exists, which makes it possible to trick another process
    (which may have different credentials) to write to its own /proc/$pid/attr/
    files, leading to unexpected and possibly exploitable behaviors. See
    <a href="../../blfs/advisories/consolidated.html#sa-10.1-054">10.1-054</a></p>

    <h4>10.1 005 Linux Kernel (LFS)  Date: 2021-03-15  Severity: Low</h4>
    <p>In Linux 5.11.3 or earlier there are vulnerabilities in iSCSI
	 subsystem which can lead to potential privilege escalation.  See
    <a href="../../blfs/advisories/consolidated.html#sa-10.1-005">10.1-005</a></p>

    <!-- End of Linux Kernel -->

    <h3>OpenSSL</h3>
    <h4>10.1 099 OpenSSL (LFS) Date: 2021-08-25 Severity: High</h4>
    <p>In OpenSSL-1.1.1l, two high security vulnerabilities were fixed that
    can lead to applications link to OpenSSL crash with malicious inputs.
    Updating to OpenSSL-1.1.1l is suggested as soon as possible.
    <a href="../../blfs/advisories/consolidated.html#sa-10.1-099">10.1-099</a>.</p>

    <h4>10.1 011 OpenSSL (LFS) Date: 2021-03-26 Severity: Critical</h4>
    <p>In OpenSSL-1.1.1k, two high severity security vulnerabilities were fixed
    that can lead to a complete bypass of the CA Certificate Store checks, and
    also one that can lead to crashes for applications that use OpenSSL.
    Updating to OpenSSL-1.1.1k is suggested as soon as possible.

    <h3>Python 3</h3>

    <a id="sa-10.1-071"/>
    <h4>10.1 071 Python (LFS and BLFS) Date: 2021-07-09 Severity: Medium</h4>
    <p>In Python3 before 3.9.6, a security vulnerability exists that could
    allow for resource exhaustion due to an infinite loop in the mod:http.client
    Python module. Update to Python-3.9.6 or later.
    <a href="../../blfs/advisories/consolidated.html#sa-10.1-071">10.1-071</a></p>

    <a id="sa-10.1-035"/>
    <h4>10.1 035 Python (LFS and BLFS) Date: 2021-04-29 Severity: High</h4>
    <p>In Python3 before 3.9.4 'pydoc' can be used to read arbitrary files,
    including those containing sensitive data. Update to Python-3.9.4 or later.
    <a href="../../blfs/advisories/consolidated.html#sa-10.1-035">10.1-035</a></p>

    <h3>systemd</h3>

    <a id="sa-10.1-081"/>
    <h4>10.1 081 systemd (LFS and BLFS) Date: 2021-07-23 Severity: High</h4>
    <p>In systemd-220 and later, a security vulnerability exists that will
    allow for a local attacker to crash your system by mounting a FUSE
    filesystem that with a file path longer than 8MB present. The crash
    occurs when reading /proc/self/mountinfo, and manifests itself as a
    kernel panic due to PID1 (init) crashing. Because fo the changes coming in
    LFS 11.0, updating to systemd-249 (with the patch) is not feasible.
    However, a patch has been created for LFS 10.1/systemd-247. See the
    advisory linked for more information. The patch replaces the current
    systemd-247-security_fix-1.patch.
    <a href="../../blfs/advisories/consolidated.html#sa-10.1-081">10.1-081</a></p>

    <a id="sa-10.1-072"/>
    <h4>10.1 072 systemd (LFS and BLFS) Date: 2021-07-09 Severity: Medium</h4>
    <p>In systemd-249, a security vulnerability was fixed that could allow for
    a remote attacker to reconfigure the network on your system. Because of the
    changes coming in LFS 11.0, updating to systemd-249 is not feasible.
    However, a patch has been created for LFS 10.1/systemd-249. See the
    advisory linked for more information.

    <h3>Glibc</h3>

    <p style="font-style: italic;">In LFS the only safe way to update Glibc is to
    build a new system.</p>

    <h4>10.1 NNN (LFS) GLIBC  Date: 2021-02-07  Severity: High</h4>

    <p>In Glibc before 2.33 there are four vulnerabilities in iconv which can lead
    to a crash when processing less-common character encodings.<p>
    Please read the link to assess the severity of this for your use case, and what
    action to take.
