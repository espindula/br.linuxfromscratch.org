    <h4>11.3 041 D-Bus (LFS and BLFS)     Date: 2023-06-17  Severity: High</h4>
    <p>In dbus-1.14.8, a security vulnerability was fixed that could allow for
    an unprivileged user to cause a denial-of-service (system message bus
    daemon crash) by sending an unreplyable message when an administrator is
    monitoring the dbus daemon. Update to dbus-1.14.8 or later.

    <h3>Glibc</h3>

    <p style="font-style: italic;"><del>In LFS the only safe way to update Glibc
    is to build a new system, but reinstall the same Glibc version with
    patches provided in security advisories should be safe.</del></p>

    <p style="font-style: italic;">Updating Glibc on a running LFS system
    requires extra precautions to avoid breaking the system.  The
    precautions are documented in an "Important" box of the LFS book section
    for Glibc.  Follow it strictly or you may render the system completely
    unusable.</p>

    <p>In Expat-2.6.2, a security vulnerability was fixed that could allow for
    denial of service via an XML Entity Expansion attack when there is isolated
    use of external parsers (created using the XML_ExternalEntityParserCreate
    function). The issue has been classified as a "billion laughs" attack,
    also known as an XML bomb attack. Update to Expat-2.6.2.

    (see <a href='../../blfs/advisories/consolidated.html#sa-11.1-011'>11.1-011</a>
