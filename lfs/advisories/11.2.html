    <p style="font-style: italic;">In LFS the only safe way to update Glibc is to
    build a new system.</p>

    <h4>10.1 NNN Glibc (LFS)  Date: 2021-02-07  Severity: High</h4>

    <p>In Glibc before 2.33 there are four vulnerabilities in iconv which can lead
    to a crash when processing less-common character encodings.</p>

    <p>Please read the link to assess the severity of this for your use
    case, and what action to take.

    injection when some modules are used. Update to Python-3.10.8 or later.

    <p>In systemd-241 and higher, a security vulnerability was discovered that
    could allow for a local information leak and privilege escalation due to
    systemd-coredump not respecting a kernel option. Rebuild systemd with the
    patch.
