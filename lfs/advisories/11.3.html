    <h2>LFS Security Advisories for LFS 11.3 and the current development books.</h2>

    <a id="LFS11.3"/>
    <p>LFS-11.3 was released on 2023-03-01</p>

    <h3>D-Bus (systemd only)</h3>

    <a id="sa-11.3-041"/>
    <h4>11.3 041 D-Bus (LFS and BLFS)     Date: 2023-06-17  Severity: High</h4>
    <p>In dbus-1.14.8, a security vulnerability was fixed that could allow for
    an unprivileged user to cause a denial-of-service (system message bus
    daemon crash) by sending an unreplyable message when an administrator is
    monitoring the dbus daemon. Update to dbus-1.14.8 or later.

    <h3>libcap</h3>

    <a id="sa-11.3-032"/>
    <h4>11.3 032 libcap (LFS) Date: 2023-06-05  Severity: Medium</h4>
    <p>In libcap-2.69, two security vulnerabilities were fixed that could allow
    for denial of service. These occur due to an integer overflow and a memory
    leak, and can be triggered when using the __real_pthread_create() and the
    _libcap_strdup() functions in libcap. Update to libcap-2.69 to fix them.

    <h3>Linux Kernel</h3>

    <a id="sa-11.3-052"/>
    <h4>11.3 052 Linux Kernel (LFS) Date: 2023-07-06  Severity: High</h4>
    <p>In Linux-6.4.1 (and Linux 6.1.31), a security vulnerability was fixed
    that allows for privilege escalation due to a memory management subsystem
    vulnerability. Update to Linux-6.4.1 or Linux-6.1.31 (LTS) to fix them.
    <a href="../../blfs/advisories/consolidated.html#sa-11.3-052">11.3-052</a></p>

    <a id="sa-11.3-011"/>
    <h4>11.3 011 Linux Kernel (LFS)     Date: 2023-03-05 Severity: High</h4>
    <p>In Linux-6.2.3 through 6.2.9 (and Linux-6.1.15 through 6.1.22),
    eleven security vulnerabilities were fixed in various kernel subsystems.
    These vulnerabilities could allow full system crash or deadlock,
    network filter bypass, or local priviledge escalation.
    Update to Linux-6.2.9 or Linux-6.1.22 (LTS) to fix them.
    <a href="../../blfs/advisories/consolidated.html#sa-11.3-011">11.3-011</a></p>

    <a id="sa-11.3-001"/>
    <h4>11.3 001 Linux Kernel (LFS)     Date: 2023-03-05 Severity: High</h4>
    <p>In Linux-6.2.2 (and Linux-6.1.14), five security vulnerabilities were
    fixed in various kernel subsystems.  These vulnerabilities could allow
    full system crashes or insufficient protection against hardware
    vulnerabilities.  Update to Linux-6.2.2 or Linux-6.1.14 (LTS) to fix
    them.

    <h3>OpenSSL</h3>

    <a id="sa-11.3-069"/>
    <h4>11.3 069 OpenSSL (LFS)   Date: 2023-08-04 Severity: Low</h4>
    <p>In OpenSSL-3.1.2, three security vulnerabilities were fixed that could
    cause excessive slowdown (and thus a denial of service) when processing
    DH keys and parameters, and for applications using the AES-SIV cipher from
    OpenSSL to be misled. Update to OpenSSL-3.1.2 (or 1.1.1v if you prefer to
    stay on the OpenSSL-1.1 series).
    <a href="../../blfs/advisories/consolidated.html#sa-11.3-069">11.3-069</a></p>

    <a id="sa-11.3-033"/>
    <h4>11.3 033 OpenSSL (LFS) Date: 2023-06-05 Severity: Medium</h4>
    <p>In OpenSSL-3.1.1, several security vulnerabilities were fixed that could
    allow for denial of service, crashes on ARM64 platforms, certificate policy
    bypass, and severe degredation of performance. Update to OpenSSL-3.1.1.
    <a href="../../blfs/advisories/consolidated.html#sa-11.3-033">11.3-033</a></p>

    <h3>Python</h3>

    <a id="sa-11.3-040"/>
    <h4>11.3 040 Python3 (LFS and BLFS)   Date: 2023-06-17  Severity: High</h4>
    <p>In Python-3.11.4, three security vulnerabilities were fixed that could
    allow for directory traversal, disk location exposure over HTTP, and for
    policy bypasses. Update to Python-3.11.4.
    <a href="../../blfs/advisories/consolidated.html#sa-11.3-040">11.3-040</a></p>

    <h3>Glibc</h3>

    <p style="font-style: italic;">In LFS the only safe way to update Glibc is to
    build a new system.</p>

    <h4>10.1 NNN Glibc (LFS)  Date: 2021-02-07  Severity: High</h4>

    <p>In Glibc before 2.33 there are four vulnerabilities in iconv which can lead
    to a crash when processing less-common character encodings.</p>

    <p>Please read the link to assess the severity of this for your use
    case, and what action to take.
