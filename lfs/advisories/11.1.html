    <h3>Glibc</h3>

    <p style="font-style: italic;">In LFS the only safe way to update Glibc is to
    build a new system.</p>

    <h4>10.1 NNN (LFS) GLIBC  Date: 2021-02-07  Severity: High</h4>

    <p>In Glibc before 2.33 there are four vulnerabilities in iconv which can lead
    to a crash when processing less-common character encodings.<p>

    Please read the link to assess the severity of this for your use case, and what
    action to take.

    <h4>11.1 028 gzip (LFS)          Date: 2022-04-15  Severity: Critical</h4>
    <p>In gzip-1.12, a critical security vulnerability was fixed that could
    allow for remote attackers to execute commands on your system (or overwrite
    existing files) when 'zgrep' is run on a crafted archive. The BLFS team has
    independently verified that the vulnerability is trivial to exploit. Update
    to gzip-1.12 as soon as possible.

    <h4>11.1 101 Linux Kernel (LFS)  Date: 2022-08-24  Severity: High</h4>
    <p>In Linux-6.0-rc2, there is a fix for a vulnerability which could be
    exploited to write into read-only memory mappings and cause privilege
    escalation.  As no fixes are backported into stable releases so far,
    disable <code>CONFIG_USERFAULTFD</code> as a workaround.

    <h4>11.1 099 Linux Kernel (LFS)  Date: 2022-08-23  Severity: High</h4>
    <p>In Linux-5.19.2 (and 5.18.19, 5.15.62, 5.10.137) there are fixes for
    four vulnerabilities which could be exploited to cause denial-of-service
    or privilege escalation.  One of those vulnerabilities can be exploited
    by an unprivileged user to cause a kernel panic easily.  Update to the
    latest stable or LTS kernel immediately.

    <p>In Linux-5.18.14.3 (and 5.15.57) are fixes for speculative vulnerabilities
    which might lead to information disclosure and have been named 'RETBleed'.
    Please read

    <h4>11.1 027 Linux Kernel (LFS)  Date: 2022-04-15  Severity: Moderate</h4>
    <p>In Linux-5.17.3 (and 5.16.20, 5.15.34 and other stable releases on 2022-04-13),
    fixes were made for three vulnerabilities in the kernel's ax25 networking
    subsystem, all of which rated as Moderate and can cause remotely-exploitable
    kernel panics. Upgrade to at least Linux-5.17.3 (or 5.15.34 or other stable
    kernels released on 2022-04-13) if you are using ax25 networking.

    <p>In Linux-5.17.1 (and 5.16.18, 5.15.32 and other stable relases on 2022-03-28),
    fixes were made for for two vulnerabilities in the kernel's nf_tables code, one
    rated as high. To fix these, upgrade to at least linux-5.17.1 (or 5.15.32 or
    other stable kernels released on 2022-03-28).

    <h4>11.1 011 Linux Kernel (LFS)  Date: 2022-03-15  Severity: Medium</h4>
    <p>In Linux-5.16.14, workarounds for hardware vulnerabilities named
    Branch History Injection have been added.  These vulnerabilities may be
    exploited to cause sensitive information leakage.
    To work around these vulnerabilities, update to at least linux-5.16.14
    (or 5.15.28, 5.10.105, 5.4.184, 4.19.234, 4.14.271, 4.9.306 for older
    systems using LTS stable kernels), and disable unprivileged bpf syscall.

    <h4>11.1 009 Linux Kernel (LFS)  Date: 2022-03-09  Severity: High</h4>
    <p>In Linux since 5.8, a local privilege escalation vulnerability known as
    'Dirty Pipe' has been discovered.
    To fix this, update to at least linux-5.16.11 (or 5.15.25, 5.10.102 for older
    systems using LTS stable kernels) using the instructions from the LFS book for

    <h3>OpenSSL</h3>

    <a id="sa-11.1-081"/>
    <h4>11.1 081 (LFS) OpenSSL  Date: 2022-07-16  Severity: Medium</h4>
    <p>In OpenSSL 3.0.4, 1.1.1p, and earlier 3.0 or 1.1.1 releases,
    AES OCB mode for 32-bit x86 platforms using the AES-NI assembly
    optimised implementation will not encrypt the entirety of the data
    under some circumstances.  This could leak sixteen bytes of the
    plaintext in the case of "in place" encryption.  If you are running
    a 32-bit LFS, update to at least OpenSSL-1.1.1q for 1.1.1 series, or
    OpenSSL-3.0.5 for 3.0 releases.
    <a href="../../blfs/advisories/consolidated.html#sa-11.1-081">11.1-081</a></p>

    <a id="sa-11.1-066"/>
    <h4>11.1 066 (LFS) OpenSSL  Date: 2022-06-22  Severity: Medium</h4>
    <p>A bug in the c_rehash script handling shell metacharacters was
    fixed in versions 3.0.4 and 1.1.1p.  This vulnerability may be exploited
    to execute arbitrary commands.  Use of the c_rehash script is
    considered obsolete and should be replaced by
    <code>openssl rehash</code> command.  Update to at least OpenSSL-1.1.1p
    if using the 1.1.1 series.  For 3.0 releases, update to OpenSSL-3.0.5 or
    later.  It's not recommended to update to OpenSSL-3.0.4 because 3.0.4
    is broken on some CPU models.

    <a id="sa-11.1-012"/>
    <h4>11.1 012 (LFS) OpenSSL  Date: 2022-03-18  Severity: High</h4>
    <p>A bug which can cause OpenSSL to loop forever when parsing a crafted
    certificate was fixed in versions 3.0.2 and 1.1.1n. Update to at least
    OpenSSL-3.0.2 if using the 3.0 series, or at least OpenSSL-1.1.1n if using
    the 1.1.1 series.

    <h4>11.1 092 Python3 (LFS and BLFS) Date: 2022-08-18 Severity: High</h4>
    <p>Two security vulnerabilities were fixed in Python-3.10.6 which could
    allow for open redirection in the built-in HTTP server, and for a
    use-after-free when using the memoryview function. Update to Python-3.10.6.

    <h4>11.1 100 Shadow  Date: 2022-08-23  Severity: Low</h4>
    <p>In Shadow-1.12.2, two security vulnerabilities were fixed that could
    allow a symlink attack while a shadow utility is running by an
    administrator and operating on a directory writable by the attacker.
    Update to shadow-1.12.2 or you'll need to take caution when you run
    the shadow utilities as root.

    <p>The same vulnerability in zgrep which was fixed in zlib-1.2.12 also
    applies to using xzgrep from xz. Upstream has provided a patch.</p>
    <p>To fix this, rebuild xz-5.2.5 with the patch or update to a later
    version when one is released.

    <a id="sa-11.1-018"/>
    <h4>11.1 018 Zlib  Date: 2022-04-04  Severity: High</h4>
    <p>A  vulnerability which allows memory corruption when deflating
    (i.e. compressing) if the input has many distant matches, has been
    found in Zlib.</p>
    <p>To fix this update to zlib-1.2.12 or later.
    Note that the update will cause 9 test failures in perl testsuite
    and these failures should be ignored.  And, if you are going to strip
    the debug symbols for your LFS system, you need to adjust the filename
    of zlib library in the stripping instruction.
