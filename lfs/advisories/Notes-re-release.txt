Updating after a new release of the books:

In LFS,

1. update index.html -

1.1 Copy the top parts to create headings for the version just released, up
    until the next version and increment the version in what will be the new
    link (both in the href and in the displayed link).

1.2 For the previous link, change 'is released' to 'was released'.

2. Copy the current 12.N.html for the new version, then edit it:

2.1 Increment the id (index.html links to this).

2.2 Change the first line to LFS-NN.N was released on CCYY-MM-DD with the
    correct version and date.

2.3 Remove most of the entries - keep one commented as a reminder of what to
    put here, and keep a commented glibc item because of the different text
    about updating.

2.4 Uncomment the 'There are currently no known security vulnerabilities for lfs-NN.N'.

Review, add new page, commit.
