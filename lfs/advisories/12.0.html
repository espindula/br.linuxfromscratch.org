    <p>In dbus-1.14.8, a security vulnerability was fixed that could allow for
    an unprivileged user to cause a denial-of-service (system message bus
    daemon crash) by sending an unreplyable message when an administrator is
    monitoring the dbus daemon. Update to dbus-1.14.8 or later.

    <h3>Glibc</h3>

    <p style="font-style: italic;"><del>In LFS the only safe way to update Glibc
    is to build a new system, but reinstall the same Glibc version with
    patches provided in security advisories should be safe.</del></p>

    <p style="font-style: italic;">Updating Glibc on a running LFS system
    requires extra precautions to avoid breaking the system.  The
    precautions are documented in an "Important" box of the LFS book section
    for Glibc.  Follow it strictly or you may render the system completely
    unusable.</p>

    <h4>12.0 085 Glibc Date: 2024-02-02  Severity: High</h4>

    <p>In Glibc 2.38, 2.37, and 2.36 (if
    <a href='../../blfs/advisories/consolidated.html#sa-11.2-075'>SA
      11.2-075</a> has been applied), there are three vulnerabilities
    in the <code>syslog</code> function and one of them can allow an
    local privilege escalation.</p>

    <p>Please read the link and fix the vulnerability immediately if you
    are running LFS 11.2, 11.3, or 12.0.

    the dynamic linker which can lead to a trivially exploitable local
    privilege escalation.</p>

    <p>Please read the link and fix the vulnerability immediately if you
    are running LFS 11.0, 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, or 12.0.

    <p>Please read the link to assess the severity of this for your use
    case, and what action to take.

    <p>In Glibc ?? (at least 2.17) through 2.38, there is a vulnerability in
    getaddrinfo() which can lead to a denial of service with custom NSS
    modules in <code>/etc/nsswitch.conf</code> and extremely rare
    situations.</p>

    <p>Please read the link to assess the severity of this for your use
    case, and what action to take.

    <h4>12.0 004 Glibc Date: 2023-09-12  Severity: Medium</h4>

    <p>In Glibc-2.36, 2.37, and 2.38 there is a vulnerability in the DNS
    resolver which can lead to a denial of service or information
    disclosure processing long DNS responses if <code>no-aaaa</code> is

    <a id="sa-12.0-092"/>
    <h4>12.0 092 Python3  Date: 2024-02-13  Severity: High</h4>
    <p>In Python-3.12.2, a security vulnerability was fixed that could allow
    for silent execution of arbitrary code via hidden *.pth files. *.pth files
    are executed automatically, unlike normal Python files which need explicit
    importing or passing as an argument to the Python interpreter. The issue
    was fixed upstream by skipping *.pth files with names starting with a dot
    (or the hidden file attribute on other systems). Update to Python-3.12.2
    (or Python-3.11.8 if you prefer to stay on that series).

    <a id="sa-12.0-068"/>
    <h4>12.0 068 systemd      Date: 2023-12-30  Severity: Medium</h4>
    <p>A security vulnerability was found in systemd-resolved that could allow
    systemd-resolved to accept records of DNSSEC-signed domains, even when they
    have no signature. Note that you must have DNSSEC support enabled on your
    system to be vulnerable to this vulnerability, and that support is not
    turned enabled by default. If you do have DNSSEC support enabled, rebuild
    systemd with the new 'sed' using the instructions from BLFS. If you do not
    have DNSSEC support enabled, no action is necessary.
