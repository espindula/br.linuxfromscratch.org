    <h3>Bison</h3>

    <h4>10.0 009 Bison (LFS)  Date: 2020-09-15  Severity: Low</h4>
    <p>Bison-3.7.2 fixed all known CVE vulnerabilities in bison itself, the
    generated code should not be affected. See
    <a href="../../blfs/advisories/consolidated.html#sa-10.0-009">10.0-009</a></p>

    <h3>Glibc</h3>

    <p style="font-style: italic;">In LFS the only safe way to update Glibc is to
    build a new system.</p>

    <h4>10.0 082 (LFS) GLIBC  Date: 2021-02-07  Severity: High</h4>

    <p>In Glibc before 2.33 there are four vulnerabilities in iconv which can lead
    to a crash when processing less-common character encodings.</p>
    <p>Please read the link to assess the severity of this for your use case, and what
    action to take.

    <h3>Python</h3>

    <h4>10.0 097 Python (LFS and BLFS) Date: 2021-02-22 Severity: Critical</h4>
    <p>Python-3.9.2 contains fixes for a critical security vulnerability as well
    as a medium-level security vulnerability. The critical vulnerability can
    lead to remote code execution. Update to Python-3.9.2 or later
    <em>using the BLFS instructions</em>.
    <a href="../../blfs/advisories/consolidated.html#sa-10.0-097">10.0-097</a></p>

    <h4>10.0 051 Python (LFS and BLFS) Date: 2020-12-15 Severity: High</h4>
    <p>Python-3.9.1 includes three security fixes. Update to Python-3.9.1
    or later <em>using the BLFS instructions</em>.

    <h3>systemd</h3>

    <h4>10.1 081 systemd (LFS and BLFS) Date: 2021-07-23 Severity: High</h4>
    <p>In systemd-220 and later, a security vulnerability exists that will
    allow for a local attacker to crash your system by mounting a FUSE
    filesystem that with a file path longer than 8MB present. The crash
    occurs when reading /proc/self/mountinfo, and manifests itself as a
    kernel panic due to PID1 (init) crashing. Because fo the changes coming in
    LFS 11.0, updating to systemd-249 (with the patch) is not feasible.
    However, a patch has been created for LFS 10.0/systemd-246. See the
    advisory linked for more information. The patch replaces the current
    systemd-246-security_fix-1.patch.
    <a href="../../blfs/advisories/consolidated.html#sa-10.1-081">10.1-081</a></p>

    <h4>10.1 072 systemd (LFS and BLFS) Date: 2021-07-09 Severity: Moderate</h4>
    <p>systemd-249 fixed a security vulnerability that could allow for a remote
    attacker to reconfigure the network settings on your computer. Because of
    it's severity and the ease of exploitation, a patch has been prepared for
    LFS 10.0/systemd-246. See the advisory linked for more information.
