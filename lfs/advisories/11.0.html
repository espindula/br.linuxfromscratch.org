    <h3>Glibc</h3>

    <p style="font-style: italic;">In LFS the only safe way to update Glibc is to
    build a new system.</p>

    <h4>10.1 NNN (LFS) GLIBC  Date: 2021-02-07  Severity: High</h4>

    <p>In Glibc before 2.33 there are four vulnerabilities in iconv which can lead
    to a crash when processing less-common character encodings.<p>

    Please read the link to assess the severity of this for your use case, and what
    action to take.

    <h3>Expat</h3>

    <a id="sa-11.0-086"/>
    <h4>11.0 086 Expat  Date: 2022-02-24  Severity: Critical</h4>
    <p>In expat-2.4.5, five security vulnerabilities have been fixed which can
    allow for trivial remote code execution and for denial of service. Update to
    expat-2.4.6 as soom as possible. See
    <a href="../../blfs/advisories/consolidated.html#sa-11.0-086">11.0-086</a></p>

    <a id="sa-11.0-068"/>
    <h4>11.0 068 Expat  Date: 2022-02-13  Severity: Critical</h4>
    <p>Two signed integer overflow vulnerabilities, both of which rated as
    Critical, have been fixed in expat-2.4.4. Update as soon as possible. See
    <a href="../../blfs/advisories/consolidated.html#sa-11.0-068">11.0-068</a></p>

    <a id="sa-11.0-064"/>
    <h4>11.0 064 Expat  Date: 2022-02-01  Severity: Critical</h4>
    <p>Several vulnerabilities, three rated as Critical, have been fixed in
    expat-2.4.3. See

    <h3>glibc</h3>
    <a id="sa-11.0-069"/>
    <h4>11.0 069 glibc               Date: 2022-02-13  Severity: Critical</h4>
    <p>In glibc-2.35, four security vulnerabilities were fixed that could lead
    to remote code execution, denial of service, privilege escalation and
    information disclosure when running applications that use the SunRPC module
    or use getcwd() to get the current working directory. Updating glibc with
    the patch can be tricky, and making a full system backup is advised before
    attempting to update it. See
    <a href="../../blfs/advisories/consolidated.html#sa-11.0-069">11.0-069</a> for
    more details.</p>
