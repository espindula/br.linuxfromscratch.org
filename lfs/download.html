     <h3>Old branch</h3>
     <p>Some old Git branches (those are inactive after 10.0 release except
     release branches) are hidden.  They are not visible in the Trac Web
     interface, nor cloned with <code>git clone</code> by default.  Read
     <a href='https://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/wiki/old-branch'>the
     wiki page</a> for details.</p>

     <h2>Systemd version of LFS</h2>

     <h3>Current Pre-release Version &mdash; LFS-12.1-systemd-rc1</h3>

     <p>This is a variation of LFS. It will be released as
     stable in the near future and is in the meantime considered to be under
     testing. This version uses systemd and the required packages and boot
     process are significantly different from standard LFS.
     Major components of the book should stay unchanged from day to
     day, but minor adjustments and bug fixes may be applied while the book
     undergoes testing.</p>

     <p>You may download the book from the
        <a href="/lfs/downloads/12.1-systemd-rc1/">LFS-12.1-systemd-rc1</a> directory.
     </p>

     <h2>Current Development</h2>
     
     <p>This is the LFS systemd Book in its current development state. Changes can
        happen that break the build temporarily.<br />
