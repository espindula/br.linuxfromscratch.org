   <h1>What is the LFS Patches Project?</h1>
   <p>
      The Patches project serves as a central repository for all patches
      useful to an LFS user. It also serves as a testing ground for patches
      that may later be incorporated into the LFS and BLFS book. The patches
      that are in the repository, but that are not included in the book, are
      primarily meant for users already familiar with LFS. First
      time LFS users should adhere to the versions and patches which are in LFS
      or BLFS.
   </p>
   <p>
      Patches are submitted by individual users, and might not be tested by the
      LFS Testing Team. They carry no warranty of any sort. Apply the patches at
      your own risk.
   </p>
   <p>
      Users who wish to submit a patch should do so by sending then as an 
      attachment to the 
      <a href="mailto:lfs-dev@linuxfromscratch.org">lfs-dev</a> or 
      <a href="mailto:blfs-dev@linuxfromscratch.org">blfs-dev</a> mailing list
      appropriate for the target script's package.  Discussion related to patches 
      should be on the appropriate development list. 
   </p>
