      <dt>jhalfs Stable Version 2.4 Released</dt>
      <dd><em>Pierre Labastie - 2017/04/08</em>
        <p>After eight years of rolling release, the jhalfs development team
           is pleased to announce the release of jhalfs-2.4. Uncountable
           changes have been made since the last version, to adapt to the new
           versions of the LFS/CLFS/BLFS books. The main new features are the
           ability to use a package manager (provided it can use <q>DESTDIR
           install</q>) and the ability to automatically install dependencies
           of BLFS packages.</p>
        <p>This release is compatible with the (B)LFS books in the 7.x series,
           as well as with the recent 8.0 versions and the current SVN, both
           Sys V and systemd. It also works with CLFS-3.x versions and CLFS
           development.</p>

          <dd><em>Jeremy Huntwork - 2005/12/02</em>
            <p>There is a <em>new</em> implementation of ALFS available, called jhalfs. The main purpose of jhalfs
	       is to provide a pure reference build of LFS by extracting the commands to run directly from the LFS
	       book. This has the added benefit of reducing maintenance as there are no profiles needed.</p>
	    <p>This is the first release of jhalfs. Version 0.1 was a proof-of-concept and not a working
	       release. You can download version 0.2
            <a href="/alfs/downloads/jhalfs/">here</a>.</p>
